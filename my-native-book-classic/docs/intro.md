# Introduction to AI-Native Development

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on **AI-Native Development**! This book explores how to build applications from the ground up with artificial intelligence capabilities as a core component.

## About This Book

AI-native development represents a fundamental shift from traditional software development. Unlike conventional applications where AI features might be added as an afterthought, AI-native applications are architected with AI integration as a foundational element.

This book covers:

- **Foundations**: Understanding large language models and core AI concepts
- **Implementation**: Building AI-native applications with modern tools and frameworks
- **Deployment**: Production considerations for AI applications
- **Ethics**: Security, privacy, and ethical considerations in AI development
